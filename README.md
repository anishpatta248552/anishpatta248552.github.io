# About Me

## My Interests
I like coding because it helps me be creative and build things. It's fun to turn ideas into real projects. I'm also really interested in video games, not just playing them, but also learning how they work. I enjoy exploring game development and trying out modding to change and improve games. Itâ€™s a fun way to combine my love for coding and games.
